  "header-s-s1-q1": "What account types does Pepperstone offer?",
  "header-s-s1-a1": `<div class="rich-text__container"><h5><strong>We provide two account types to meet the needs of traders</strong></h5>
    <h5><strong>Razor Account</strong></h5>
    <h5>Our Razor accounts include raw spreads, which means we pass on the spreads we receive from our liquidity providers directly to our clients. </h5>
    <h5>Unlike MetaTrader, when you trade on cTrader, the commission rate is determined by the currency you are trading in, not the currency in which your account is deposited. The commission rate for cTrader Razor accounts is seven units of the first quote currency in the currency you are trading - for example, a NZDCAD one lot trade will incur a commission of NZ$7. </h5>
    <h5><strong>Standard Account</strong></br></h5>
    <h5>Our standard account is commission-free and includes our original spread + 1 pip increase (eg 0 pip spread plus 1 pip = 1 pip [0.5 pips in each direction for bid and ask prices). </h5></div>`,
  "header-s-s1-q2": "What is a swap?",
  "header-s-s1-a2": `<div class="rich-text__container"><h5>FX swap rate refers to the overnight or rollover interest (i.e. earned or paid Interest). These rates are determined by interbank spreads and cross currency basis. </br></br>Swap charges go both ways. This means that traders can earn swap fees, or they may also incur swap fees on related trading positions. This will depend on the instrument being traded, whether your position is long or short, and whether the trade was held during the rollover. Since spot FX contracts are settled on a T+2 basis, triple swap charges will be charged to account for weekend interest when rolled over on Wednesday. </h5></div>`,
  "header-s-s1-q3": "Is Pepperstone an ECN/STP trader or a market maker?",

  "header-s-s1-a3": `<div class="rich-text__container"><h5>We get asked this question a lot. Part of the difficulty in answering this question is that ECN and STP are marketing terms taken from the listing market regime, and are given different meanings by different providers in the industry. </h5>
   <h5>A true ECN or STP broker is an introducing broker or a broker that operates under a white label program using someone else's system. </h5>
   <h5>We are the issuer of the products we offer and we control the systems we use because we tend to have our customers have a direct relationship with us. </h5>
   <h5>Nevertheless, we can also be considered an "ECN" broker as we do not run any proprietary trading accounts. In contrast, we obtain pricing from external liquidity providers (whose pricing is not provided by us or anyone related to us) via electronic communications networks, and this pricing is passed on to you and our other clients without The trading desk intervenes. </h5>
   <h5>Hedging every trade increases the likelihood of problems with the second leg of the trade, which will also affect the first leg. Therefore, we do not hedge every position with external liquidity providers as we want to provide you with a better product by bringing you price certainty and speed. Rest assured, we take our risk management practices very seriously and closely monitor our exposures to ensure we are not exposed to undue risk. </h5>
   <h5>We consider a "market maker" to mean someone who operates a trading desk and creates their own prices, which may be based on their own proprietary trading positions or exposures. We do not currently operate in this manner, so while we have a market making authority on the AFS license (like every other licensed product issuer in Australia), we do not consider ourselves a market maker. </h5>
   <h5>For more information on this, please contact <a href="mailto:support@pepperstone.com">support@pepperstone.com</a>. </h5></div>`,
  "header-s-s1-q4": "What are the trading conditions of your platform?",
  "header-s-s1-a4": `<div class="rich-text__container"><h5>Our goal is to provide low transaction costs and fast execution for a variety of financial instruments. </h5>
   <h5>You can find out about our trading conditions through the "Trade with us" section, which describes the financial instruments we offer, swaps, spreads and commissions, trading accounts, etc. </h5>
   <h5>You can also visit our <a href="https://eu-assets.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltaec35894448c7261/blt344c54e7351de81d/5e814aa9cbf5456e10c03334/Pepperstone_PDS_zh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferr ">Product Disclosure Statement (PDS)</a> and <a href="https://eu-assets.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltaec35894448c7261/bltb34da167f9077be3/5e814aacc897616d4c467d1b/Pepperstone_Terms_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel ="noreferrer noopener">Terms and Conditions</a> document for important information. </h5></div>`,
  "header-s-s1-q5": "How do I open an account?",
  "header-s-s1-a5": `<div class="rich-text__container"><h5>To open a real account, please go to our homepage and select "Real Account> to open a real account.</ h5>
   <h5>This process takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete online. You will be prompted to complete an admissions quiz and provide your account opening identification documents, which can be uploaded online during the application process. </h5>

    <h6><strong>MT4 vs. MT5 - our opinion</strong></h6>
    <h6>We’re one of the world’s largest MT4 brokers so it’s no secret we’re fans of this popular platform. MT4 is a straightforward, intuitive and loved trading platform. It’s a classic - it’s perfect for both beginners and advanced traders because of its broad functionality.</h6>
    <h6>A benefit to MT4 having such a vast community of users globally is their site, mql5.com, which holds an extensive range of indicators, signals, EAs you can buy and download and add in easily to the platform.</h6>
    <h6>In addition to these add ons, Pepperstone here in Australia has its own affiliations with companies such as myFXBook, Duplitrade and Zulutrade who offer social trading solutions that are easy to set up, and give the users control over what they choose to invest their money in.</h6>
    <h6>MT5 though, is here to change the game. It’s a platform known for its wide range of time frames, analytical prowess and variety of pending orders, loved most by our share and commodity traders.</h6>
    <h6><strong>The wider range of time frames available</strong> (21 time frames as opposed to MT4, which has 9) This is also extremely attractive for scalpers and for advanced traders who are looking to do in depth analysis of the market.</h6>
    <h6><strong>Pending Orders:</strong> MT4 offers stop and limit orders which are generally the most commonly used ones, whereas with MT5 you have the functionality to use stop limits too, which is a superior way of setting a limit order.</h6>
    <h6><strong>The programming languages for MT4 and MT5 are MQL4 and MQL5.</strong> Although there is more likely to be a larger amount of research and guidance for MT4 due to its popularity, users are starting to migrate to the MQL5 programming language as it’s more efficient and easier to use, and traders can write and alter scripts.</h6>
    <h6><strong>MT5 also offers a built in fundamental economic calendar delivering live macroeconomic news. </strong>MT5 contains an inbuilt MQL5 Community Chat and email system.</h6>
    <h6><strong>There’s certainly been more of a move towards MT5 from the trading communit</strong>y, which is what we’re seeing here when we look at our own client base. Our clients tend to be more sophisticated and informed investors, so the inclusion of MT5 is welcomed by many of our clients who have been heavier users of MT4 only in the past.</h6>
    <h6><strong>Contrary to popular belief though, MT5 has not been built to replace MT4.</strong> It’s here to supplement it. Here at Pepperstone, our investors use both MT4 and MT5 and get the best of both worlds and we support their trading approaches with online resources, access to webinars and of course, 24/5 support.</h6>
    <h6><strong>Generally, for beginner traders or clients who are looking to just trade forex, MT4 is a straightforward and efficient choice. For our traders looking for a niftier software, with a broader range of additional features, and more in-depth analysis then MT5 is more suitable. Furthermore, if you’re looking to trade the top US Share CFDs, then look no further than MT5.</strong></h6></div>`,

  "m4-mn-a1-c": `<div class="rich-text__container"><h5>Traditionally, markets trade based on interest rate or yield differentials. All else being equal, capital tends to flow into the system with higher interest rates, increasing the demand for currencies with higher yields. A classic example of this is USD/JPY, which is closely correlated with U.S. Treasury yields. Higher US yields typically lead to stronger USD and weaker JPY as the US-Japan yield gap widens (YCC caps 10yr JGB yields at 0.5%), while if US Treasury yields fall, the spread narrows, Demand for the yen rises. </h5></div>`,
  "m4-mn-a1-c2": `<div class="rich-text__container"><h5>Speaking of the yen leads us to the idea of shorting currencies, which involves borrowing (or shorting) low yielding currencies , to buy high-yielding currencies with the aim of capturing the difference in interest rates between the two currencies. Although this gives the trader two profit opportunities: to profit from favorable market movements, and to profit from charging interest. But it also leaves traders with two risks when these positions are open; adverse market movements can wipe out any interest earned on the position. </h5><h5>Traders can often find short-selling opportunities in foreign exchange cross trading. By comparing the yields offered by each currency in the G10 monetary system. Typically, a trader will use the Japanese Yen as a funding currency because of its low and stable interest rates, while holding the Australian or New Zealand dollars because the interest rate gap between these currencies is often wide. </h5><h5>However, shorting a currency is best done in an environment where foreign exchange and interest rate volatility is low and expected to remain low for an extended period of time. As the chart below shows, this is not the case at the moment, as markets currently involve a number of geopolitical risks, coupled with uncertainty about the stability of high inflation, the future direction of central bank policy, and the length and magnitude of the slowdown in economic growth. </h5></div>`,
  "m4-mn-a1-c3": `<div class="rich-text__container"><h5>Based on the above information, in foreign exchange trading, a better way to hold long-term positions is to keep the three themes mentioned above in mind, and Consider that they may vary across major global economies. </h5><h5>A sharp rise in interest rates and a sharp slowdown in economic activity, for example, could be bad for the economy with debt-laden consumers and an over-leveraged fragile housing market. Canada and New Zealand are prime examples. Economies such as the euro zone and the United Kingdom, which have stuck to interest-rate mortgage lending, may be a bit more resilient. </h5><h5>This has led to some thought on potential trading opportunities to take advantage of relative differences in expected economic performance. In this area, EUR/CAD could be a good bet, and the technical outlook supports such a view, especially if the bull market can break decisively above the 1.4645 double top formed in late 2021/early 2022. </h5><h5>Foreign exchange crosses can not only be reflected by the real estate market, but differences in the outlook for monetary policy are still important themes. Especially when the market expects at least one of the Bank of Canada, Australia and New Zealand to cut interest rates by the end of the year, while also expecting the Bank of England and the European Central Bank to keep rates at terminal levels. If traders are willing to take the central bank's guidance directly, they can play down rate cut expectations by going long AUD, NZD and CAD. </h5></div>`,

As real yields rise, it reduces the relative attractiveness of holding gold, which does not yield any yield.

  "m4-mn-a3-d":
    "Everyone knows that yesterday's inflation data is very important, and it turned out to be a blockbuster, destroying the recent optimistic market sentiment, triggering a series of sell-offs and revaluation of assets.",
  "m4-mn-a3-ti": "September 14, 2022",
  "m4-mn-a3-c": `<h5>The annual rate of CPI in August in the United States fell to 8.3%, and the market expected 8.1%. The core CPI climbed to 6.3%, higher than the expected 6.1% and the previous value of 5.9%. The expected decline in headline inflation was only less than expected, and what is more worrying is the stickiness shown by core inflation. The price reduction of rent, new cars, medical care, transportation, etc. will take a longer process. </h5>
   <h5>After the release of inflation data, the recent optimistic market sentiment has been dealt a devastating blow. The trading logic of "peak inflation" no longer exists, and investors have begun to reassess the future path of interest rate hikes and asset price trends. </h5>
   <h5><strong>Rate hike outlook</strong></h5>
   <h5>The probability of raising interest rates by 75 basis points at the Fed meeting next week is almost certain, and the probability of raising interest rates by 100 basis points even exceeds 30%. Facing persistently high inflation and the looming mid-term elections, the Fed must strike hard. In addition, the terminal interest rate of this round of interest rate hike is expected to rise to 4.3%, and it is expected that the interest rate will reach above 4% in January next year at the earliest. To make matters worse, at present, the Federal Reserve not only acquiesced in the economic recession that may be caused by raising interest rates, but even intentionally "manufactured" a recession to lower inflation. This has led to a frantic sell-off of risky assets. </h5>
   <h5><strong>Market reaction</strong></h5>
   <h5>The two-year U.S. bond yield, which is more sensitive to interest rates, jumped to 3.75%, the highest level since 2007, helping the U.S. dollar index (USDX) rebound to 109.60, recording the largest single since March 2020 daily increase. </h5>
   <h5>Non-US currencies plummeted across the board. USD/JP rose to 144.50, with the previous high of 145 within easy reach. The euro returned to below the level of parity, and the sharp drop in the German ZEW business sentiment index also formed a drag. The pound fell below 1.15, and today's UK CPI data may cause another wave of shocks. The Australian dollar fell to 0.6730 near the low for the year, and the New Zealand dollar fell below 0.6000 for the first time in two years. USD/CNH is infinitely close to the psychological barrier of 7. </h5>
   <h5>The three major U.S. stock indexes fell between 4% and 6%, which was also the worst single-day performance since 2020. The VIX index rose to a two-month high of 27. The S&P 500 erased the gains of the past 4 trading days in one day, and 3900 points is a position that must be held. Tonight's PPI data will be another challenge. </h5>
   <h5>Gold fell to around 1700, and the support of 1680/95 attracted attention again. Silver ended its four consecutive positive days and fell back under pressure near the trend line since June. </h5>
   <h5><strong>Outlook</strong></h5>
   <h5>Before next week's Fed policy meeting, members cannot make public remarks during the quiet period, and other economic data are no longer important, so the risk-off market triggered by inflation data may continue for a while. </h5>
   <h5>In the two years after the outbreak, complying with the Fed's super loose policy is the simplest and most effective way to invest, which is commonly known as don't fight against FED. Now entering the tightening cycle, interest rate hikes are deepening, market liquidity is tightening, and the Fed's acquiescence to the economic recession, it seems that the stock market and other risky assets (such as digital currency, commodity currency, etc.) will encounter more headwinds. The turning point is the inflation rate that will continue to fall in the future. </h5>`,

    "On the eve of the market's eagerly awaiting US inflation data, the US dollar has continued to pull back, while US stocks have continued to rise. Commodity prices have recovered and silver jumped 5%. ",

  "m4-mn-a4-c": `<h5>The latest survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that residents' inflation expectations for the next one and three years have dropped to 5.7% and 2.8%, although they are still significantly higher than before the epidemic low, but has come down significantly from its peak. Tonight's August inflation figures are likely to show a similar trend. </h5>
   <h5>The CPI forecast range is between 7.9% and 8.3%. Compared with the 9.1% and 8.5% in the previous two months, it can be seen that the slowdown in inflation growth is a high probability event. Inflation is expected to fall 0.1% month-on-month, which could be the first decline since May 2020 and is expected to help CPI fall from 8.5% to 8.1% year-on-year. </h5>
   <h5>If the annual inflation rate falls below 8%, it is likely to extend the rebound in the stock market, gold and euro, and put pressure on the dollar, even if the core inflation rate is still above 6%. If the value is higher than 8.4%, the stock index's rally may temporarily subside, and the recent trend may be reversed. </h5>
   <h5>Although inflation slowdown is the current mainstream view, the probability of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates by 75 basis points in September remains at about 90%, and the terminal interest rate is expected to be above 4%. Before the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance does not change, it seems difficult for the S&P 500 to break through 4250, and it is difficult for commodities to really return to the upward trend. </h5>
   <h5>In the overnight market, as the U.S. dollar index reached an inflection point, non-U.S. currencies also took advantage of the trend to rebound, breaking away from multi-year lows. The euro closed on Monday close to the upper track of the channel at 1.0200, hitting a one-month high intraday. </h5>
  
   <h5>The European Central Bank's hawkish voice is an important bullish. As US inflation cools and European prices continue to rise, the difference in monetary policy between the two places is gradually narrowing, and may no longer constitute a factor for the euro's depreciation. In addition, the recent continuous decline in natural gas prices also boosted the short-term trend of the euro. </h5>
   <h5>Gold benefited from the adjustment of the US dollar and returned to above 1720. The bulls were a little relieved that no lower lows were formed. 1745 is the next target above. Silver rose more than 5% yesterday and approached the $20 mark. Whether it can break through with the trend still needs to pay attention to tonight's inflation data. </h5></br>`,

   <h5><strong>Stock Market</strong></h5>
   <h5>The three major U.S. stock indexes closed up for the first time in four weeks. Among them, the S&P 500 came back above the 100-day moving average, and the 50-day moving average crossed the 100-day moving average. </h5>
   rz2bw170yq3j"></h5>
   <h5>In the past period of time, the actual volatility and implied volatility (VIX) of the S&P have both declined, attracting funds to enter the market, and technical support is also formed near the trend line, but the resistance above is still very clear. </h5>
   <h5>Although the US dollar pulls back and the stock market rebounds in the short term, this week's CPI data may change the trend and tone of the entire financial market. </h5>
   <h5>The U.S. CPI on Tuesday night is expected to fall by 0.1% month-on-month, which may be the first decline since May 2020, and may help the CPI fall from 8.5% to 8.1% year-on-year. The CPI forecast range is between 7.9% and 8.3%. It can be seen that the slowdown in inflation growth is a high probability event. Any figure below 8% is expected to extend the rally in stocks, even if core inflation remains above 6%. If inflation is higher than 8.4%, the stock index may return to below 3900 points. </h5>
   <h5>Major stock indexes in Europe and Asia also closed up last week, but the Hang Seng Index was the bottom performer. </h5>
   <h5><strong>Gold and Oil</strong></h5>
   <h5>The price of gold was supported in the 1680-1695 range last week, and this week we will continue to pay attention to whether this can become a phased bottom. The sharp rate hike by the European Central Bank caused the dollar to avoid the sharp edge, and gold took advantage of the situation to rebound. If the US CPI data continues to decline this week, will it have the same effect? But in any case, the September rate hike of 75 basis points and the Federal Reserve's hawkish rhetoric are still the current market consensus, which will limit the rise in gold prices. </h5>
   ="ugt5zn34s9wv"></b></h5>
   <h5>The international oil price continued its recent decline after falling below the support of the long-term trend line. Fundamentals still revolve around Russia’s (oil price ceiling) and imposed (export ban) sanctions, but the economic slowdown makes the medium and long-term trend of oil prices bearish, and a series of Chinese economic data this Friday is expected to have a significant impact. If WTI crude oil fails to break through $90, it may retest the level of $80 and lower. </h5>
   <h5><strong>Foreign Exchange</strong></h5>
   <h5>The U.S. dollar index has shown signs of falling from its 20-year high. Will it pull back to the 107 line this week? CPI data will obviously speed up or reverse the trend of the index. The Fed has entered a quiet period before its policy meeting, which may give us a clearer look at the impact of data (rather than personal opinion) on the dollar. At present, the probability of raising interest rates by 75 basis points this month is around 90%. </h5>
   <h5>The European Central Bank raised interest rates by 75bp last week, the largest rate hike in history. It also raised its inflation forecast for the whole year and hinted that interest rate hikes will not stop. The probability of raising interest rates by 75bp in October is 65%, and QT may also be discussed at that time. The implementation of caps or subsidies on electricity prices in many European countries has temporarily eased the pressure on sky-high bills. The development of the fighting in Ukraine helped the euro open higher on Monday. 1.0115 (50-day moving average) is the next target for the euro's rebound. After breaking through, it is expected to rise to 1.2000. This is the upper track of the half-year-long downward channel, and it is expected that there will be obvious resistance. </h5>
   <h5>The UK will usher in a lot of economic data this week. The most critical inflation is expected to remain at 10.1%. The new Prime Minister has introduced a cap on energy bills to prevent runaway inflation, but this may in effect slow down the Bank of England's rate hikes. The Queen's death delayed the BoE meeting by a week. Sterling stabilized at 1.1412 last week, but the rebound may be stalled around 1.1760. </h5>
   <h5>If you see overheating CPI data on Tuesday, the US/JPY will hit the 145 line, otherwise it will step back around 139. Potential Bank of Japan intervention is the factor preventing the yen from depreciating too quickly. </h5></br>`,

   <h5>The biggest focus of today's ECB meeting is the rate hike. At present, the probability of raising interest rates by 75 basis points has reached 64%, and the market expects to add another 50 basis points in October and December, raising the key interest rate to 1.75% before the end of the year. Energy prices continue to soar, inflation is expected to exceed 10% before the end of the year, the economic environment is rapidly deteriorating, and social unrest has begun to spread. For the central bank, the time window for substantial interest rate hikes is closing. </h5>
   <h5>Since the euro has partially priced in a 75 basis point interest rate hike, the impact of this interest rate decision on the euro should be asymmetric. If the 75bp euro is expected to rise slightly and test 1.0050, the 1.0115 above is a more important resistance level. If it is only 50bp, the euro may fall sharply or even fall to 0.9700, because this will make the market question the determination of the central bank to fight inflation and increase the monetary policy difference between the United States and Europe. </h5>

   <h5>The central bank will also release its latest economic forecast today. If a recession is expected in early 2023, the euro will also sell off and return to 20-year lows. The previously estimated growth rate of 2.1% in 2022 will also face downward revision risks. Peak inflation is expected to rise above 10%. </h5>
   <h5>In addition, we need to pay attention to the situation of the balance sheet. While raising interest rates in advance, shrinking the balance sheet may not be the key topic of this meeting, or even this year, especially considering that Italy’s September election may further widen the interest rate differential between Italy and other European countries. The central bank may keep the market liquid for now. </h5>

   <h5>You can also gain more flexibility and advantages by trading stocks through contracts for difference (CFD), such as long-short two-way operations, leverage advantages, deep market liquidity, 5*24 non-stop trading, etc. Of course, you also need to have a certain risk tolerance to deal with extreme fluctuations and emergencies in the market. </h5>

European natural gas futures prices soared 30% at the opening on Monday and closed 12% higher throughout the day. This trend fully reflects the impact of Russia's indefinite suspension of gas supply from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. </h5>
   <h5>The impact of the energy crisis on prices has been protracted. The West seems to have no intention of stopping Russia (it is discussing the implementation of a crude oil price ceiling), and the fighting nation will naturally not let it go. The United States itself is a big energy country and may be able to get through it safely, but European countries that are highly dependent on Russian energy are not so lucky. Goldman Sachs analysis pointed out that the average energy bill of European households will reach 500 euros / month early next year, which is expected to increase by 200% compared with 2021. For Europe as a whole, the total amount of excess energy bills will account for 15% of GDP.

Looks tough, as the U.S. has little to show weakness ahead of November's midterm elections. Winter in Europe will be colder than usual. </h5>
   <h5>Crude oil prices jumped 2% on Monday, driven by a rebound in natural gas prices. OPEC+ announced a production cut of 100,000 barrels per day starting in October, both to ease the recent downward pressure on oil prices and to hedge against possible incremental supply from Iran in advance. This production cut actually just canceled the 100,000 barrels per day production increase quota decided last month, so the oil price response was not obvious and even narrowed the increase.

   <h5>The three major US stock indexes fell for three consecutive weeks. </h5>
   <h5>The latest non-agricultural report showed that 315,000 new jobs were created slightly better than expected, but the previous value was revised down, and the growth rate of hourly wages slowed down, and the unemployment rate rose from 3.5% to 3.7%. The Fed’s previous aggressive rate hikes seem to be showing some results, with expectations for a 75-basis-point hike in September now down from 75% to 56%. </h5>
   <h5>However, Russia's decision to cut off supply to Europe indefinitely still hit the market risk sentiment. Except for energy stocks, all other sectors closed lower on Friday. </h5>
   <h5>There is not much heavy data in the US market this week. In addition, Monday is the Labor Day holiday. The volatility of US stocks in the next few days may be more affected by external factors such as energy prices, geopolitics and European interest rate hikes. . Under the expectation of raising interest rates and shrinking the balance sheet, the overall trend of the stock market is still bearish. </h5><h3><strong>Crude oil and gold</strong></h3>
   <h5>OPEC+ will hold a ministerial meeting today. It is the mainstream expectation that the output will remain unchanged, but the possibility of reducing output has not been completely ruled out. The magnitude of the production cuts, if any, will determine the height of the oil price rally. </h5>
   <h5>Another factor that may be positive in the short term is the mutual pinch between Europe, the United States and Russia. Last Friday, the G7 reached an agreement on setting a price ceiling for Russian crude oil, and the specific ceiling will be further discussed at this Friday's EU energy ministers meeting. In response, Russia announced an indefinite suspension of gas supplies from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. </h5>
   <h5>WTI (SpotCrude) temporarily stabilized above 86 but is still far below the 200-day moving average. OPEC production cuts and natural gas supply cuts may help oil prices rebound briefly. Conversely, if it falls below 86, it may face the risk of a sharp decline. </h5>
   <h5>Gold saw some safe-haven buying on Friday amid tensions between Russia and the European Union. Of course, the cooling expectations of the Fed's interest rate hike also provided breathing space for gold prices. However, gold, which has fallen for three consecutive weeks, is still in a weak situation. Pay attention to the support area of ​​1680-1695. If it can return to above 1720, the alarm will be temporarily lifted. </h5><h3><strong>Forex</strong></h3>
   <h5>The U.S. dollar index (USDX) did not fluctuate much after the release of the non-agricultural data, and climbed to a new 20-year high after rising for three consecutive weeks. There is not much data this week, and the focus will be on Powell's speech on Wednesday. </h5>
   <h5>Euro fell slightly last week but opened lower at 0.9925 this Monday. Some European countries have begun to take the form of government subsidies or price caps to alleviate the soaring electricity prices, and power cuts are also possible options. The impact of the energy crisis on the economy is self-evident, of which Germany and Italy are the most exposed. </h5>
   <h5>In the face of record-high inflation, the probability of the European Central Bank raising interest rates by 75 basis points this Thursday has come to 64%, and new economic and inflation forecasts will also be released at the same time. If the interest rate is only raised by 50 basis points this time, the euro may fall sharply. In the short term, focus on whether the exchange rate can hold the 0.9900 line. </h5>
   "></h5>
   <h5>The pound fell nearly 2% in a week and closed below 1.15. There is no doubt that Truss will become the new British Prime Minister. The result will be announced on Monday. Her emergency budget and cabinet members will be the next focus, but it is difficult to produce any practical help for the pound. </h5>
   <h5>The Federal Reserve Bank of Australia will announce its interest rate resolution on Tuesday, and it is expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points. In addition, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank will deliver a speech on Thursday, from which the future path of interest rate hikes can be glimpsed. The AUD's one-week implied volatility is 11.9%, implying a 93 pips move (up or down) in the exchange rate this week. Last week's low of 0.6771 is the first place to watch. In addition, China's economic data, the epidemic and the yuan will also have an impact on the Australian dollar. </h5>
   <h5>The Bank of Canada is expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday. But oil prices and the outlook for the global economy are more important factors in commodity currencies. The US/Canada target is the July high of 1.3223.

   <h5>Better-than-expected employment data (such as 400,000 new jobs) will strengthen the FED's hawkish stance and clear the way for a substantial interest rate hike in September, thereby extending the decline in US stocks in recent trading days, S&P 500 Fearing that it will fall below 3900 points, the US dollar index and US/JPY will continue to rise. </h5>
   <h5>If the new jobs are much lower than expected (such as 150,000 or even lower), the expectation of raising interest rates in September will be lowered, and the US dollar may fall significantly from the 20-year high. The S&P is in the hammer shape and 61.8% There may be some support near the retracement level, and the rebound rate of Nasdaq is expected to reach 2%. </h5>

   <h5>The expectation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 75 basis points in September has reached 70%. The two-year U.S. bond yield, which is most sensitive to policy interest rates, has risen to the highest level since 2007. The hawkish remarks of FED officials are endless . The expectation of substantial interest rate hikes is always a lingering shadow over the stock market, unless we see a sustained downward trend in CPI. </h5>
   <h5>In addition to raising interest rates, the Fed’s balance sheet reduction will also accelerate to a monthly scale of US$95 billion in September, twice the previous US$47.5 billion. The financial conditions index has risen over the past week, suggesting that liquidity is starting to tighten again. Under the combination of raising interest rates and shrinking balance sheets, this trend may continue in September. </h5>
   <h5>In addition, from the perspective of seasonal effects, September is usually the worst month for European and American stock markets. In the past 30 years, the average decline of US stocks in September was about 0.5%, and the average decline of STOXX 600 (European Stoxx 600 Index) exceeded 1%. It is pointed out that if you can survive September, the performance of the stock market in the last quarter of each year is worth looking forward to. </h5>

   <h5>The U.S. dollar index (USDX) has risen for three consecutive months, setting a new high in 20 years, which not only reflects the expectation of raising interest rates, but also proves once again the safe-haven nature of the U.S. dollar and its ability to harvest the world. </h5>
   <h5>It is not surprising that the euro fell by 1.7% in a single month and then broke the parity level. Although natural gas prices fell continuously at the end of the month and the hawkish stance of the European Central Bank (the inflation rate in the euro zone was 9.1% in August) contributed to the rebound of the euro, but this cannot fundamentally solve the difficulties facing Europe. If the European Central Bank's interest rate hike on September 8 fails to satisfy the market, it is still a high probability event that it will fall below parity again. </h5>
   <h5>The pound fell 4.6% in August. It is predicted that British inflation will reach more than 20% next year, and a recession is inevitable. The pound is rapidly moving towards the low point of 1.1409 in March 2020. Commodity currencies such as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada performed quite well, falling in step with commodity prices. The US/Japan is definitely the focus of short-term attention. Today, after setting a new 24-year high, it is only a short distance away from the 140 mark, and this should not be the top position. </h5>
   <h5>Gold closed lower for five consecutive months! It is approaching the 1700 integer mark, but there is still a very strong support at the 1680 line. Since 2020, the price of gold has stabilized and rebounded here many times. </h5>

It can be said that oil is the foundation of the second industrial revolution and is known as the "blood of industry". Oil not only affects people's daily life and economic development, but also affects the global financial, political and military structures. </h5>
   <h5>After the end of the gold standard, the "petrodollar" is one of the important pillars supporting the "dollar hegemony". In the 1970s, the United States required all oil transactions to be settled in U.S. dollars on the grounds of providing military protection to Saudi Arabia. Oil importing countries followed suit, and the dominance of the U.S. dollar in oil trade was formed, which greatly enhanced the value of the U.S. dollar. demand. Exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia, based on security and liquidity considerations, then use the dollars they earn to buy U.S. treasury bonds or commodities, allowing the U.S. government and the public to obtain borrowing at a lower cost for a long time, and the U.S. dollar has never left from the beginning to the end.

   <h3><strong>Crude Oil Trading</strong></h3>
   <h5>Crude oil futures are the main channel for trading crude oil. They can not only provide physical delivery, but also achieve hedging or speculation/investment purposes. The world's two most important oil futures contracts are WTI (US crude oil) and Brent crude oil. The main difference between the two lies in the refining location, trading time and location, sulfur content (the lower the oil, the lighter the oil and the easier it is to refine), etc. To put it simply, U.S. crude oil transactions are mainly based on WTI oil prices, while about two-thirds of global crude oil transactions are based on Brent oil prices. </h5>
   <h5>However, crude oil futures are relatively complicated, and the threshold is relatively high, which is more suitable for enterprises or professional investors with actual trade needs. Therefore, for our ordinary investors, crude oil contract for difference trading (CFD) may be easier to get started. </h5>
   <h5>Crude oil CFD trading also includes two investment targets, namely WTI and Brent. They have the same characteristics as trading foreign exchange and gold, such as supporting long-short two-way operations, leverage advantages, high market liquidity, 5*24 uninterrupted trading, and low cost. Both are priced from the futures market. </h5>
   <h5>In addition to earning the price difference through the rise and fall of a single product, another typical way to trade crude oil is to observe the price difference between WTI and Brent. Due to the high degree of homogeneity of the two, theoretically the price difference will remain within a reasonable range. Once we find that the spread widens and deviates from the long-term average, it often means a potential trading opportunity. At this point you can short the higher price and simultaneously long the lower price, betting that the spread will return to the mean in the short term. </h5>
   <h3><strong>Factors Affecting Oil Price</strong></h3>
   <h5>There are many factors that affect oil prices, such as economic cycle, geopolitics, OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) production control, technological revolution, etc. In the final analysis, it is determined by the relationship between supply and demand. For example, the increase in demand during the economic upcycle will boost oil prices; or the explosion of US shale oil production capacity in the past decade has increased supply, causing WTI oil prices to fall sharply and remain lower than Brent oil prices for a long time. </h5>
   <h5>Oil prices have crashed twice in the past ten years. Once after the 2008 financial crisis, it fell from a historical peak of 147 to $33. The other time was at the beginning of the outbreak in 2020, when futures prices fell to negative values. The current crude oil price is hovering around $100/barrel. A supply crunch caused by the Russia-Ukraine war and a recession-induced drop in demand are working together. </h5>

  "m4-mn-a13-c": `<div class="rich-text__container"><h5>The market at the beginning of this week generally continued the trend of last Friday, and everyone should still digest the hawks in Powell's speech Signal. The three major U.S. stock indexes continued to fall, among which technology stocks were still the hardest hit. Gold dropped to 1720, the U.S. dollar index (USDX) briefly broke through the 109 mark and closed at 108.55, and the British pound and Japanese yen continued to fall. </h5>
   <h5>The interest rate market predicts that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 69 basis points in September, and the terminal interest rate will reach 3.84% next year, a further increase from last week. The more hawkish expectations may be the main logic of the market before the non-farm payrolls this Friday. </h5>
   <h5>What was quite surprising yesterday was the rebound of the euro, which returned to above the parity level in the intraday session. This is not easy in the context of Powell's hawkish remarks. On the one hand, it is because the US dollar index failed to break through the double top in July and August in one go, but the main reason is that the price of natural gas in Europe fell sharply by 15%. The European Union is considering intervention and reforms in the energy market, including discussions on introducing electricity price caps to ease energy bills and inflation rates that have been "out of control" in European countries. Meanwhile, Germany said it could meet its 85% gas storage target ahead of schedule in September. </h5>
   <h5>Nevertheless, all measures the EU can take will not be able to reverse the contradiction between supply and demand in the energy market. In the short term, we can pay attention to the consolidation range of the euro at 0.9910-1.0033. Before breaking through last week's high of 1.0090, we still maintain a bearish view. Data such as the economic sentiment index for the euro zone in August and the CPI for Germany in August will be released today. </h5>
   <h5>USD/CNH broke above 6.91 for the first time in two years. The figure below shows that the two-year treasury bond spread (blue line) between the United States and China has set a new high for many years, which reflects the differences in the monetary policies of the two countries, while USDCNH (yellow line) is catching up, breaking 7 may only be a matter of time . Since mid-August, the People's Bank of China has not only cut interest rates, but also raised the central parity rate of the U.S. dollar and renminbi, which seems to be hinting or guiding the market direction. It is worth noting that it is possible to make profits in both directions of exchange rate and interest rate difference by bullish USDCNH now.
   <h5>International crude oil prices continued to rise, news that the Iran nuclear agreement negotiations were delayed until September and OPEC may announce production cuts next week helped WTI close at a nearly one-month high of 97.67. The next target for the bulls is clearly $100, which is the 38.2% retracement of the downtrend from June, an important psychological level and the location of the 50-day moving average. </h5>

<h5>September 1 (Thursday): China August Caixin Manufacturing PMI, Eurozone August Final PMI, US August ISM Manufacturing PMI, US Initial Applicants</h5>
<h5>September 2 (Friday): U.S. non-farm payrolls in August</h5><h3><strong>What the global central bank annual meeting revealed</strong></h3>
<h5>Powell reaffirmed his determination to fight inflation in his short speech last Friday. He believes that only one month of data improvement is not enough to convince the central bank that inflation is falling, so he does not rule out raising interest rates by 75 basis points in September (referring to data in the next three weeks), and keeping interest rates above the neutral level for a long time (limited sex region), even if it may cost the economy recession. </h5>
<h5>Powell's speech is consistent with the recent stance of other Fed officials, and together they dispelled the market's expectations of "the Fed's policy shift". </h5>
<h5>The U.S. two-year yield rose to 3.45%, the highest since 2007, and the 10-year yield stabilized above 3%. Futures markets point to the federal funds rate hitting 3.81% in March next year. </h5><h3><strong>Stock market</strong></h3>
<h5>The three major US stock indexes fell sharply on Friday. The dovish expectations that previously supported the stock market's 20% rebound from June all the way have disappeared after the central bank's annual meeting. Continued sharp rate hikes and skyrocketing odds of a recession sparked a market sell-off. The major stock indexes have fallen below their ascending channels and long-term moving averages. </h5>
6r47svfdy0b7"></h5>
<h5>This week, the stock market will also face the test of end-of-month rebalancing, full-speed shrinking of the FED’s balance sheet in September (tightening liquidity), and non-agricultural data. The market expects that 300,000 new jobs will be added in August, the unemployment rate will remain at 3.5%, and the growth rate of hourly wages will rise slightly to 5.2%. A strong labor market is one reason the Fed has been able to raise interest rates boldly. </h5>
<h5>The mainland and Hong Kong stock markets were significantly impacted at the opening on Monday, but the 1 trillion yuan stimulus plan and the Sino-US audit cooperation regulatory agreement can offset the negative factors in the external market to a certain extent. Major stock indexes in Asia-Pacific fell more than 2% in early trading. </h5><h3><strong>Gold and crude oil</strong></h3>
<h5>Gold fell more than 1% on Friday, erasing all the gains made in the previous trading days. The outlook for gold is bearish amid the Fed's reaffirmation of its hawkish stance and a stronger dollar. If it falls below 1727, which does not seem to be a very strong support, the price of gold may fall again to the low of 1680 this year. </h5>
<h5>Oil prices jumped 3% last week, boosted by OPCE's output cut signal. However, factors such as the progress of the Iran nuclear agreement, the slowdown of the global economy, and the strong dollar have always been factors that restrict oil prices from rebounding to previous highs. WTI oil price is expected to experience a period of volatility around $95, and a breakthrough above 100 or below 85 will start the next stage of the trend. </h5><h3><strong>Forex</strong></h3>
<h5>The U.S. dollar index (USDX) jumped to the 109 mark on Monday, setting a new high in 20 years. This week's PMI and non-agricultural data are better than expected, or the stimulus index will rise further, while the public speeches of many Fed officials are expected to stick to the hawkish stance. </h5>
<h5>Euro closed below the parity level last week, and the long upper shadow line on Friday suggested that there is strong resistance near the parity level. Natural gas prices in Europe soared by 40% in a single week, and electricity prices in France and Germany rose by 70% in a week, setting new record highs every day. The downward spiral of the euro and soaring energy prices has created a vicious circle, exacerbated by heat waves and drought. The ECB appears to be considering a 75 basis point rate hike in September, but that won't stop the eurozone from slipping into recession, or the euro's slide. Eurozone CPI is expected to hit 9% this week. </h5>

<h5>After the USD/JPY broke through 137.46, the next target for the bulls is obviously the July high of 139.38. </h5>
<h5>The Australian dollar rose slightly last week due to the rebound in commodity prices such as iron ore and China’s stimulus measures. However, at the moment when the risk sentiment has dropped in an all-round way, the outlook for commodity currencies is still worrying. This week, focus on the support around 0.6720. </h5>`,

  "m5-tg-a2-s2-c": `<div class="rich-text__container"><!--StartFragment--><h5>If we expect increased market volatility, the first thing we need to do is to clearly understand The maximum risk that can be tolerated in each transaction. Setting a stop loss is the best risk management method. </h5>
   <h4><strong>Gap risk</strong></h4>
   <h5>The gap is a very important risk factor, so we need to carefully evaluate the risk brought by the open interest in a certain period of time. Especially when the market is closed on weekends, we cannot conduct transactions in real time, and there are certain risks. Setting stop loss in advance is a very effective way to deal with it. </h5>
   <h4><strong>Position control is the key</strong></h4>
   <h5>The setting of the stop loss price determines the size of the position, and the latter is proportional to the net value of the trading account. For example, if you have $1000 in your account and the leverage ratio is 500:1, it is not recommended that you use $900 as a margin to trade EURUSD at this time, because you may face additional calls in a short period of time (especially when the market price fluctuates violently) Margin Risk. </h5>
   <h5>In a volatile market, how to effectively control positions is an important factor that distinguishes professional traders from novices. For those who want to execute transactions and even earn profits in high volatility, position control is the most important one of the trading principles. </h5>
   <h4><strong>Guide to trading under high volatility</strong></h4>
   <h5>The main task of a trader is risk control, so it is particularly important to understand how the actual and implied price fluctuations affect trading strategies. Here are some trading guides. </h5>
   <h5>1. <strong>Use technical indicators to monitor volatility</strong></h5>
   <ol></ol>
   <h5>Realized volatility measures the degree to which asset prices in financial markets deviate from a preset mean. This is a very helpful statistic for trading. Two of the best known volatility-based technical indicators are Bollinger Bands and the Average True Range (ATR). </h5>
   <ul><li><strong>Bollinger Bands</strong></li></ul>
   <h5>Bollinger bands represent the degree of price volatility above and below the 20-day moving average. The wider the range and the wider the price movement or distribution around this short-term mean, the more we need to consider reducing our position size. </h5>
   <h5> From the perspective of mathematical statistics, in 95.4% of the cases, the price will be distributed between the upper and lower rails of the Bollinger Bands (the distance of 2 standard deviations on one side). When the market is sold off, customers usually regard the lower track as a short-term downside risk reference. So the price tends to drop to this point very quickly. </h5>
   <ul><li><strong>Average True Range (ATR)</strong></li></ul>
   <h5>In a rapidly changing market, it is recommended to use a 3-day or 5-day ATR to assess the intensity of daily fluctuations. Traders not only need to compare ATR with the value of the past period of time (such as 12 months), but also need to pay attention to the absolute level of ATR and use it to define the current market risk. </h5>
   <h5>In any time frame, ATR can prompt us at what price to set the stop loss. When the stop loss price is determined, we can adjust the position. For example, when the 5-day ATR of USDJPY is 210 points, the stop loss price can be set at a position 210 points away from the entry price. If you plan to hold a position until the stop loss is triggered, there is a huge risk during this period, so it is recommended to reduce the trading position appropriately. </h5>
   <h5><strong>Key takeaway: Taking on more risk without reducing your position can be disastrous. </strong></h5>
   <h5>Many traders may set the stop loss to 1.5 times ATR, leaving more buffer space. But doing so adds risk when realized volatility itself is already very high. Especially for traders with low account net worth, they are facing the possibility of liquidation. </h5>
   <h5>2. <strong>Reasonably choose trading products</strong></h5>
   <ol></ol>
   <h5>Each type of financial product has its own characteristics, and also has different degrees of volatility. For example, the average daily volatility of the Nasdaq 100 is greater than that of the S&P 500, while the average daily volatility of the Nikkei 225 is greater than that of the ASX200. Among currency pairs, AUDJPY tends to have stronger volatility than AUDNZD. </h5>
   <h5>Therefore, we not only need to pay attention to the different leverage ratios of trading products, but also need to know their different fluctuation ranges. </h5>
   <h5>Many traders will use 1% or 2% of the account equity to make a single transaction, but this theory is too rigid. We should adjust this ratio appropriately according to the volatility of the product and its own nature. </h5>
   <h5>3. <strong>Volatility has nothing to do with direction</strong></h5>
   <ol></ol>
   <h5>Higher ATR or Bollinger bands only describe the intensity of price fluctuations, and cannot predict the direction of price movements. We use volatility to adjust the size of positions to prevent being forced out, but this does not tell us where the best entry point is. </h5>
   <h5><strong>4. Lifestyle</strong></h5><ol></ol>
   <h5>Facing the rapidly changing market, you may need to change your original lifestyle and trading habits. During periods of extremely high volatility, some normally insignificant news stories can send prices into sharp two-way swings. If you can't stick to the screen at this time, you may not be able to respond in time, and you will fall into a passive position. As traders, we need to be ready to react to price changes, so you need to get used to this way of life. </h5>
   <h5>5. <strong>Liquidity is the foundation of everything</strong></h5>
   <ol></ol>
   <h5>In a rapidly changing market, market makers and liquidity providers may not be able to provide the same scale of liquidity. Especially when important news is announced, the lack of liquidity will make the market worse. </h5>
   <h5>In times of high volatility, market participants are eager for more information about economic, geopolitical or liquidity crises. In this dynamic process, the information itself will cause large price changes, which may be a test for many retail trading customers. Fortunately, Pepperstone can be your important and reliable source of information. </h5>
   <h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
   <h5>I hope the above suggestions can provide some help for your transactions in a market environment with high volatility. Although there are many other technical indicators based on realized volatility, what is more important is how to use these indicators flexibly to deal with the vagaries of the market. </h5>
   <h5>In fact, the most important rule in trading is to learn to adapt, that is, not only to ensure that the direction of the transaction is consistent with the market trend, but also to accept the reality that not every transaction will be profitable. If you can pay attention to leverage and extreme volatility to implement more precise risk control, and adjust your positions reasonably, then you have mastered the way to survive in an extremely volatile market. </h5>

  // Educational m5-Trading Guide-Why spreads widen
  "m5-tg-a3-s1-t1": "Why the spread will expand",
  "m5-tg-a3-s1-d1":
    "Pepperstone knows that transaction costs are the most important concern of customers, so we have been committed to providing customers with competitive spreads in the industry. By connecting with many top investment banks and liquidity providers, we provide you with the best trading Bid/Ask price.",
  "m5-tg-a3-s2-c": `<div class="rich-text__container"><!--StartFragment--><h4><strong>Spread</strong></h4>
   <h5>In foreign exchange and CFD CFD trading, the cost of the transaction is generally measured by "spread", that is, the difference between the buying price and the selling price at the same time. For example, if the quotation of EURUSD is 1.06747/52, then the spread of the currency pair is 1.06752-1.06747=0.00005, which is 0.5 points (pip). Generally, when the market liquidity is higher, the spread is lower, and the transaction cost is lower. </h5>
   <h5>However, in an extremely volatile market environment, market depth and transaction execution efficiency are greatly weakened, so spread expansion is a common phenomenon at this time, which is common in the entire financial market, whether you are an institutional investment or retail customers. </h5>
   <h5><strong>Why the spread changes</strong></h5>
   <h5>The liquidity of the market and the speed of price changes largely determine the size of the spread. In times of extreme market volatility, liquidity is the most important factor in trading, especially for institutional investors like pension funds or hedge funds. When the market is hit or whenever a major news event is released, liquidity will be the first to be affected. If liquidity dwindles or dries up, price jumps will be more dramatic. Therefore, liquidity is the key driver of market price changes. When the liquidity in the market decreases sharply, it will often cause a chain reaction to form a vicious circle, which will lead to further tightening of liquidity. </h5>
   <h5><strong>What is liquidity</strong></h5>
   <h5>Liquidity reflects the ease with which market participants open and close positions. This is very important for institutional investors such as funds. The orders placed by these institutions are usually huge. Sometimes, due to insufficient market depth, all transaction orders cannot be executed at the best buying or selling price at the same time. </h5>
   <h5>In a highly liquid market, the order will not cause too much impact on the existing market price when it is executed, and market participants can provide the best quotation, so the spread at this time is narrowed. </h5>
   <h5>However, if the market is full of panic and price volatility is high, market participants will trade more frequently and be forced to reduce the size of their positions. In this case, the seller believes that the price will fluctuate wildly and the market depth is insufficient, so it may set the selling price at a higher position than the current quotation. Conversely, buyers tend to place bids below the current price in markets where prices fluctuate rapidly but lack depth. When the buyer (seller) wants to trade at a lower (higher) price, when these orders push the buying and selling price away from the fair value, the spread that is transmitted to the foreign exchange broker through the liquidity provider expands. </h5>

  // Educational m5-Trading Guide-Limit Up and Down Limit
  "m5-tg-a4-s1-t1": "Limit Up and Limit Down",
  "m5-tg-a4-s1-d1":
    "Because of the circuit breaker (commonly known as 'limit up and down') system, when stocks and stock indexes experience extreme movements, trading is suspended for a period of time. Investors have the opportunity to use this time to reassess the current market situation.",
  "m5-tg-a4-s2-c": `<div class="rich-text__container"><!--StartFragment--><h4></br><strong>Which trading products are affected by this</strong> </h4>

   <h5>Although most traders are very concerned about the price limit of the stock index, in fact, individual stocks, energy, interest rates and agricultural product markets all have daily price limit. </h5>
   <h4>Trading Rules</h4>
   <h5>When the market fluctuates violently, the price limit may affect your opening and closing positions, so it is very necessary to understand the specific trading rules. In a rapidly changing market, you may not be able to trade if you encounter extreme sell-offs or surges. While you can get help through our customer support team, it is possible that market trading has been suspended due to price or stock index triggering a circuit breaker level. </h5>
   <h4><strong>The origin of the circuit breaker mechanism</strong></h4>
   <h5>After Black Monday in 1987 had a severe impact on the market, people designed the price limit system to deal with the violent fluctuations of stocks and stock indexes. In addition to the continuous emergence of buy or sell orders in the same direction, wrong quotations or market price manipulation can also cause extreme price fluctuations. The regime was updated accordingly after the 2010 market flash crash. </h5>
   <h5>Through this system, investors can quickly evaluate the price trend during the trading suspension period, and the market also has the opportunity to re-examine whether the current price is reasonable and effective. </h5>
   <h4><strong>The mechanism of price limit</strong></h4>
   <h5>Although the price limit applies to many different US stock indexes (such as US30, US200, NAS100, etc.), in this article we will take US500 (ie S&amp;P 500) as an example for introduction. </h5>
   <h5>The quotations of all stock index products including US500 on the Pepperstone platform come from the futures market. The expected future dividend and interest income has been reflected in the quotation model, which is also affected by the circuit breaker mechanism in the underlying market. </h5>
   <h5>There are different price limits at different times of the trading day, reflecting the liquidity of the market. And liquidity will exacerbate the degree of two-way price fluctuations. </h5>
   <h4><strong>Trading restrictions for stock index futures during the opening session</strong></h4>
   <h5>When the spot market has closed but the S&P 500 index futures market is still trading, the US500 price limit is +/-5%. The calculation of this ratio is based on the closing price at 4:00 pm (US Eastern Time, the same below) of the previous day. </h5>
   <h5>When the index falls and touches the 5% lower limit, the sell order will no longer be executed, and traders can only buy futures contracts at this time. </h5>
   <h4><strong>Price limit during spot market opening hours (09:30am - 4:00pm)</strong></h4>
   <h5>During the trading hours of the spot stock market, there are a total of three levels of circuit breakers. </h5>
   <h5><strong>Level one fuse (7%)</strong></h5>
   <ul><li>09:30am - 03:25pm: If the index fluctuation reaches +/-7% during this time period, trading will be suspended for 15 minutes. There will be no restrictions on buying and selling after trading resumes. </li><li>03:25pm - 4:00pm (closing): Trading will not stop and prices can float freely until the index triggers the third level circuit breaker (+/-20%)</li></ul>
   <h5><strong>Secondary fusing (13%)</strong></h5>
   <ul><li>09:30am - 03:25pm: If the index fluctuation reaches +/-13% during this time period, trading will be suspended for 15 minutes. Unlimited buying and selling after trading resumes</li><li>03:25pm - 4:00pm (closing): Trading will not stop and prices can float freely until the stock index triggers the third level circuit breaker (+/-20%)< /li></ul>
   <h5><strong>Third level fuse (20%)</strong></h5>
   <ul><li>If the index fluctuation reaches +/-20%, trading will be suspended for the day</li></ul>
   <h5>The above rules vary from market to market. In the case of high volatility, the possibility of price triggering trading limits is very high, so traders need to pay attention to the market limit conditions of the products being traded. </h5>

  // Educational m5-Trading Guide-Volatility Index (VIX)
  "m5-tg-a5-s1-t1": "Volatility Index (VIX)",
  "m5-tg-a5-s1-d1":
    "Volatility plays a very important role in the market. Whether traders use manual trading strategies or execute trades through automated trading algorithms, volatility is a core element in financial markets.",
  "m5-tg-a5-s2-c": `<div class="rich-text__container"><!--StartFragment--><h5>One of the most famous measures of implied volatility is the CBOE The Volatility Index (VIX) of the Institute (CBOE). Now, we have provided customers with transactions of this index on the MT4/5 platform. </h5>
     <h3>What is the Volatility Index (VIX)</h3>
     <h5>The VIX index is essentially a measure of the expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index. Like any other option implied volatility, VIX is presented as an annualized standard deviation (percentage). By weighting the volatility in different S&P 500 index option pricing models with maturities between 23 and 37 days, the final 30-day rolling implied volatility, the VIX index, is derived. </h5>
     <h5>The VIX you see is actually the expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index in the next month, presented as an annualized percentage value. In addition, the market index will float in this range in 68.2% of the cases. </h5>
     <h5>To put it simply, if the VIX is at a level of 20 (%), the market expects the S&P 500 to rise or fall by 20% in the next 12 months. </h5>
     <h5>Traders can do some simple calculations on the basis of this annualized value to get the expected volatility of the S&P 500 within any period of time (such as a day or a week). For the options market, volatility is a very important parameter. It is based on a mathematical formula and quantifies the expected trend within a certain probability range. </h5>
     <h3><strong>Calculation example of volatility</strong></h3>
     <h5>Volatility is essentially the annualized standard deviation. If we want to know the expected volatility per day, we first need to know how many trading days there are in each year, and then multiply it by the square root sign and the annualized volatility. If you want to know the expected weekly volatility, take the number of weeks in a year and multiply it by the annualized volatility. We assume that the current VIX index is 20%. </h5>
     <h5><em><u>How do I calculate the expected daily volatility?</u></em></h5>
     <h5>Use the square root of the total trading days in a year: √252=15.9</h5>
     <h5>Daily expected volatility=1.25% (20/15.9=1.25)</h5>
     <h5><u><em>How do I calculate the expected weekly volatility?</em></u></h5>
     <h5>Use the square root of the total number of trading weeks in a year: √50=7.07</h5>
     <h5>Weekly expected volatility=2.8% (20/7.07=2.8)</h5>
     <h5>Suppose the S&P 500 is now at 3300 and the VIX is 20. Because the daily expected volatility is 1.25%, this indicates that the market expects the index to rise or fall by 41.3 points (3300*1.25%) within the day, and the implied volatility reaches 82.6 points, which is within one standard deviation of the current price within (68.2% of cases). </h5>
     <h5>Sometimes the market moves in a different direction than expected. However, whether you are trading S&P 500 index options, S&P 500 spot index, other US stock indexes (US30 or NAS100), or other asset classes, if you can quantify the market's expectations for price fluctuations, it is very useful for trading helpful. </h5>
     <h5> It should be reminded that volatility has nothing to do with direction, so it cannot be used to predict the direction of future price movements. In theory, the VIX could rise when the S&P 500 rises or falls rapidly. But case studies of many market panic situations have shown that during times of market uncertainty and a decline in the S&P 500, we typically see the VIX spike, which is why many refer to the VIX as the "fear index." </br></br></h5>
     <h5>High volatility and why</h5>
    
     <h5>Source: Bloomberg VIX Index</h5>
     <h3><strong></br></strong></h3>
     <h3><strong>Increase trading efficiency with volatility index</strong></h3>
     <ul><li><strong>Trading the VIX Index Directly</strong></li></ul>
     <h5>When you understand what the VIX means and can calculate the expected volatility for the S&P 500, you can tell if that level of volatility is too high or not enough. If you buy the VIX index, you are anticipating greater volatility in the S&P 500 (i.e. traders pay more for options on the index). If you sell the VIX then you expect volatility to drop and the market to become calmer. </h5>
     <ul><li><strong>Risk management through the VIX</strong></li></ul>
     <h5>If we can understand the expected volatility range of the S&P 500 Index, it can better help us set stop losses and adjust positions in a timely manner. For example, if I trade based on a daily chart and tend to hold positions for a day to two weeks. With the VIX showing an average daily range of 1.25%, a stop loss around 0.3% below the market price would be easily triggered. In this case, it is Meiji's choice to set a lower stop loss and reduce the position. </h5>
     <ul><li><strong>How volatility affects trading strategies</strong></li></ul>
     <h5>During a period of low volatility, it is difficult to achieve a high rate of return through the appreciation of the currency itself, so arbitrage trading becomes very effective at this time. In the forex market, low volatility tends to lead to strong performance in high-yielding currencies such as MXN, and high-yielding stocks have more buyers. Investors unwind carry trade positions if volatility is high, and the funding currency (JPY, CHF or even EUR) outperforms at this time. </h5>
     <h5>During periods of high volatility, traders tend to buy quality and defensive assets such as US Treasuries, gold, and favor companies that provide stable income, such as utility stocks. At the same time, growth and cyclical stocks will present better shorting opportunities. </h5>
     <ul><li><strong>Volatility and EA trading</strong></li></ul>
     <h5>If your EA has an advantage in a low-volatility, two-way market, a high VIX market environment means your EA may not perform well. So you may choose to reduce your positions, or even temporarily close all positions. Conversely, if your EA outperforms during periods of higher volatility, you can expect greater gains in high VIX markets. Assessing expected market conditions with the VIX can give you more confidence in the environment in which your EA is operating. </h5>
     <h3><strong>Understanding the VIX</strong></h3>
     <h5>Although changes in the VIX index are often reported in the news, because the index is aggregated from multiple S&P 500 index option price models, traders cannot actually trade the index directly. Now, Pepperstone offers clients a tradable spot index product with front-month VIX futures contracts (which are liquid, efficient and heavily traded) adjusted for fair value weights. </h5>

They act decisively when it comes to execution, but they are also able to patiently track their transactions.

Some trade quickly, get in and out of the market in seconds, make five points here, ten points there. Others may be calmer, taking just one or two trades per trading day, carefully waiting for the perfect moment to take advantage of the day's changes. Champion day traders can be boisterous and rowdy, but they learn not to bring ego into their trading operations. What if the market goes against its expectations? They either quit or pursue other ways. For day traders, it's all the same. What they care about is whether they cut their losses and keep making profits, not whether they are right. They may only win on half of their trades, but through excellent risk management, they are profitable every day. Pepperstone trading style: short-term/intraday</blockquote>

  // Educational m5-trading guide how to trade gold with non-US currencies
  "m5-tg-a7-s1-t1": "How to trade gold with non-US currencies",
  "m5-tg-a7-s2-c": `<div class="rich-text__container"><h5>At Pepperstone, gold has always been the most popular investment target for traders, and we have been committed to providing you with More updated gold trading products. The most popular gold trade is denominated in US dollars (XAUUSD). But at Pepperstone, you can now trade gold in up to <a href="https://pepperstone.com/en/trading/instruments/commodities/">5 currencies</a>. This article will introduce you to the advantages of gold denominated in non-US currencies. </h5>
   <h5>Gold has an unassailable position in the macroeconomic and financial markets. The gold trading market is highly liquid, and you can always find suitable investment opportunities in different market environments. </h5>
   <h5>Most commonly, gold is traded in U.S. dollars. However, if you are bullish on both gold and the U.S. dollar, the strategy for maximizing your investment in gold is to buy bullish gold with other currencies that you think are likely to depreciate. If the market moves in the same direction as you expect, you will be able to obtain both gold (value-added) and non-US currency (depreciation) income. For example, Gold/GBP (XAUGBP) made new all-time highs in May 2020 because we saw strength in gold and weakness in the pound at the same time. </h5>
   <h5> This logic works in reverse as well. If you think gold is going to fall and you are worried about the dollar depreciating, you can sell gold for a strong currency to get the most out of it. </h5>
   <h5>Of course, adding the trend prediction of multiple currencies to gold trading will make the transaction more complicated. But many traders usually trade both gold and foreign exchange markets. Therefore, if you can choose an appropriate currency to trade gold, it will not only help you improve your trading techniques for commodities and currency pairs, but also enrich your overall trading strategy. </h5>
   <h3>Investing in gold in non-US currencies under the current economic environment</h3>
   <h5>Gold has not reached a new high against the US dollar (XAUUSD) since 2011 due to the strengthening of the US dollar. Trading opportunities for XAUUSD are limited when the USD and Gold are moving positively. </h5>
   <h5>However, you can now trade gold opportunities in GBP and CHF. Combining the previous gold transactions denominated in US dollars, Australian dollars and euros, there are currently as many as 5 options for gold transactions. </h5>
   <h5>Gold against the Australian dollar (XAUAUD) broke out of the all-time high of 2765 on March 24 in the early days of the outbreak. In the following period of time, under the influence of global risk aversion, gold against the euro (XAUEUR) and gold against the British pound (XAUGBP) set new record highs respectively. Gold/CHF (XAUCHF) has had a great run lately. While you might think that the Swiss franc would strengthen because of its safe-haven status, the SNB is actually adopting a strategy similar to pegging to the euro. So when XAUEUR set a new high on May 18, XAUCHF also recorded a historical high. </h5>
   <h3>Better pricing</h3>
   <h5>Pepperstone offers competitive spreads on the latest gold product launch. The lowest point difference of XAUGBP and XAUCHF is 0.08, and the average point difference is 0.38 and 0.4 respectively. </h5>
   <h3>Translate market readings into trading strategies</h3>
   <h5>Through Pepperstone's rich gold trading options, you will have the opportunity to further improve and enrich your trading strategies. When you have a certain expectation on the rise and fall of gold, choose a currency that is most opposite to the trend of gold, and combine the two to form a transaction. Of course, once the market trend is inconsistent with your expectations, it may also increase your losses. </h5>
