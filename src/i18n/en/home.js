However, with the increasingly fierce mining competition and the advent of professional mining machines, the cost of personal participation in bitcoin mining has increased. Bitcoin mining has entered a large-scale and centralized professional era. From equipment procurement, finding preferential electricity prices, mine site selection and construction, to dedicated management and post-maintenance, every step requires a lot of capital investment. The output of bitcoin is halved every four years, that is, the number of bitcoins mined under the same computing power will decrease, which means that the cost of a single bitcoin will rise. In addition, OKLink data shows that the computing power of the entire Bitcoin network has been rising, so the more computing power, the greater the difficulty of mining, and the higher the cost of obtaining Bitcoin. Bitcoin rarely falls below its own mining cost price in history. Once it falls below, because it is mining at a loss, some miners will choose to stop the loss and leave the market. At this time, the computing power will drop and the difficulty of mining It will also be lowered accordingly, and the cost of Bitcoin will also decrease accordingly. Therefore, some people believe that the cost of mining has a certain reference value for the price of Bitcoin.",

At present, we have seen that more and more listed companies, private companies, and fund companies have begun to add Bitcoin to their investment portfolios. In addition to diversifying investment risks, it also plays a role in increasing returns. Bitcoin investing is becoming increasingly mainstream. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has said that bitcoin could overtake gold as millennials become a more important part of the investment market and they prefer "digital gold" to traditional gold. Ten years ago, the price of 1 bitcoin was only $30, but now the value of bitcoin is up to $60,000, outperforming inflation by a large margin. However, some people believe that although the price of Bitcoin continues to rise, it has high volatility and high investment risk.
